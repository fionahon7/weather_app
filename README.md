This is a CLI tool for a Historical Weather Application based on the provided weather data for
three cities (Boston, MA; Juneau, AK; Miami, FL).

Assuming you already have a Python environment set up, you must have `pandas` installed.

To run this from the root of the repo:
`python historical_weather.py <function-name> [options]`

* `function-name`: can be days-of-precip or max-temp-delta
* `options`: CLI options for the given function to run. You can find more information about this in historical_weather.py

Note: if I'd had more time, I would expand my tests to be more extensive and cover all functions, conditions, and not just the golden path.
